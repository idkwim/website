        <p>Hello!</p>
        
        <p>We're absolutely and completely thrilled at the response to our game 
        this year! As we said during the closing ceremonies, we're honored 
        and proud that you all competed with us, and would like once again 
        to thank:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Dark Tangent and the other DEF CON organizers, for supporting our 
        plans to host.</li>
          <li>The DEF CON Goons, for helping make the contest in Vegas a fun and 
        enjoyable venue.</li>
          <li>The twenty teams that competed in finals, for running a friendly, 
        honorable, and skillful game. You all did a great job, no matter 
        where you ended up on the scoreboard.</li>
          <li>The 898 teams that competed in the qualifying game in June, for 
        your spectacular show of skill in solving our challenges over 2400 
        times.</li>
          <li>And last, but certainly not least, we'd like to thank our friends, 
        families, and significant others, for forgiving our long nights and 
        exhausting weekends over the last several months.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>While we did get a small chance to explain the game during closing 
        ceremonies on Sunday night, we'd like to share a more detailed and 
        thoughtful set of results.</p>
        
        <h1 id="zero-sum">Zero Sum</h1>
        
        <p>The finals game this year was zero-sum: the game started with 50,000 
        flags, allocated 2500 per team. It ended with 50,000 flags, although 
        less evenly distributed. Capturing a token would net you an even 
        share of the nineteen flags that token was worth, with "remainder 
        flags" being reallocated later.</p>
        
        <p>What this meant for the game flow was a terrible calculus for leading 
        teams. Teams with no flags will obviously not be very lucrative 
        targets. Teams with large stockpiles of flags were also more likely 
        to turn any exploit launched at them around as a new attack, 
        devaluing the exploit.</p>
        
        <p>Teams competent at attacking but not focused on defense saw massive
        flag losses that they, generally, weren't able to capture them back 
        quick enough.</p>
        
        <h1 id="one-hour-left">One Hour Left</h1>
        
        <p>With an hour left in the game Sunday afternoon, we had PPP at the 
        top of the leaderboard, followed by "men in black hats" and 
        "raon_ASRT," who had finished Saturday with shockingly close scores.
        The black-hatted gentlemen were leading by fewer than 240 flags, 
        which meant that the Korean team might be able to mount a comeback 
        for the second place.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, it was not to pass. Most of the teams stayed in the
        same relative standings during the game's final hour, and the top
        end of the scoreboard bled even more flags from the lower portions:
        PPP managed to capture over a thousand flags in the last sixty
        minutes.</p>
        
        <p>As the final bars of Europe's "The Final Countdown" echoed through the
        room, we confirmed to ourselves the final top three:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>PPP</li>
          <li>men in black hats</li>
          <li>raon_ASRT</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1 id="two-mistakes">Two Mistakes</h1>
        
        <p>We made a few mistakes and misjudgements during the game, from network 
        settings causing a few captured tokens to expire without capture, to 
        scoring logic errors that left Legitimate Business Syndicate with an 
        incredible number of flags, we have a few things to fix next year. 
        The two mentioned mistakes have an impact on game scoring.</p>
        
        <p>The misconfigured network caused teams to be incorrectly throttled in 
        their connections to the REST API that redeemed tokens for flag 
        captures. This meant that some teams weren't able to redeem captured 
        tokens due to the busy and hostile network environment. Since this was
        discovered on Sunday morning, after a long night of discovering new
        vulnerabilities, it was especially painful.</p>
        
        <p>We have reprocessed those expired tokens based on logs and scorebot 
        data, since they disproportionately and unfairly affected individual 
        teams unevenly. They are included in the final results. </p>
        
        <p>The scoring logic error that left remainder flags in our possession 
        affected all teams equally; while this may have resulted in different 
        scores, we believe that not only did it affect all teams equally and 
        fairly, we also hold that changing this would invalidate many teams' 
        actions during the game. All twenty competing teams played the game 
        as implemented, not the game we wish we did after the fact.</p>
        
        <p>We have not factored the missing remainder flags into the final 
        results.</p>
        
        <h1 id="three-observations">Three Observations</h1>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Each token was worth nineteen points, split between every team 
        that redeemed it. Fourteen teams figured out that if they redeemed 
        their own tokens, they'd deprive other teams of valuable flags.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Non-virtualized team hardware removed most of our concerns about 
        CPU starvation due to malicious action. The remaining concerns were 
        based on cooling capacity and reduction thereof when the lid was off 
        the box holding team hardware.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Teams with fewer than fifty flags are pretty much a rounding error: 
        since we processed captures and SLA failures sequentially instead of 
        in parallel, whether or not they were rewarded for captures or
        penalized for getting owned last was displayed in their score, 
        although they didn’t have control of this.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1 id="whats-next">What's Next</h1>
        
        <p>We'd like to get more data out to you soon! Check back this weekend.</p>
        
        <p>We'd also like to get next year's game scheduled. Check back when we've
        had a long vacation.</p>
